# üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Don't start coding.

---
class: middle

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do ask questions
- How large is the data set?
- Is this the only use case?
- What should happen in null cases?
- What should happen when the program ends?

# Explain the problem before coding
This helps gain common understanding between you and the interviewer

---
class: center, middle

# Start coding.

---
class: center, middle

# Run your code as much as possible.

---
class: center, middle

(75% of developer I interview will run their first function, then they will write the _entire_ program before trying to run their code again. It _never_ works. _ever_.)

# You'll find some unexpected issues.

# Acknowledge the problems with your approach.

# Primary goal is to get working code.

# Once you have it, then optimize and test.

# Redefine the problem you're trying to solve.

---

# It's okay to draw a diagram on some paper.

---
class: center, middle, dark

# Think of the smallest case that would work.
Break it up into small chunks.

---
class: center, middle, dark

# The interviewer will most likely give you a hint.

---
class: center, middle, dark

# It's still OK if you don't know.
## Talk about how you think a solution _might_ work, even if you can't implement it.

---
class: center, middle

# After your solution, explain what could be done better.

---
class: middle

# These are common:
- What would you change if there were 1,000,000 data points/calls to this function?
- What is the Big O notation?
- What's the most non-performant part and why?
- How would you test this?
- How would you refactor this?

---

# Be receptive to feedback.

---
class: center, middle

# Try to ask company-specific questions.

---
class: center, middle

# If you don't get an offer.
Ask if there's any feedback that you can learn from for next time.

---
class: center, middle

# If you get an offer, always negotiate for higher compensation.
Generally 10%-15% is a good range in my opinion.

The worst is that they hand you the original offer again.

Also, if asking for higher compensation is a problem for the company, you probably don't want to work there.
